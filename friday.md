### Domain Driven Design
- looking at software from top down
- focus should be on business, rather than technology
- domain is the business we're trying to solve
    - banking, insurance, e-commerce
- models of the domain, make our software conform to that
- closing te gap between business reality and code
- ex: Windows 8, well made and looks good, but didn't add features that were helpful/wanted
- Domain Driven Design is not inherently related to OOP, but in practice it makes use of OOP concepts
